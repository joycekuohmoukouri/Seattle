# Seattle net zero
Nobody can ignore climate change anymore. In 2016, the city of Seattle decided to roll up its sleeves and monitor the greenhouse gaz emissions and the energy comsumptions of its building.

---

**Goal**

- Find the best model to predict future energy consumptions and CO2 emissions
- Use the feature importance to reflect on the reasons for high energy consumptions

The data was collected here :  [City of Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov).
